**1. Scaling the Namenode - Lessons Learnt**     
Tuesday, September 21, 2021 18:50 UTC   

We have all heard the phrase 'HDFS is battle tested'. Yet we often experience or hear from others about the HDFS scalability issues.   
This begs the question - what do we really mean by saying HDFS is battle tested and why do we still run into battleground situations with HDFS?   
This talk is targeted for HDFS/Hadoop users [admins, developers, end users, architects] basically anyone who uses HDFS in any capacity.   
This talk will present the lessons learnt from the field and will focus on key tuning/optimization in HDFS to help you leverage the underlying features of HDFS and run it smoothly at scale.

**2. Apache Ozone - State of the Union**         
Thursday, September 23, 2021 17:10 UTC   

Apache Ozone was initially a subproject under Apache Hadoop that aimed to solve the HDFS scalability challenges.   
Since its inception as a subproject few years ago, it has come a long way to graduate as an Apache Top Level Project.   
This talk will focus on a brief history of Ozone, the progress made thus far, comparisons with HDFS performance, and the road ahead in scaling beyond a billion files in the system.
